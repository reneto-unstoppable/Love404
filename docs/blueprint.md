# **App Name**: 404 Haunting

## Core Features:

- Anonymous Login: User authentication using Firebase, offering both standard and anonymous login (assigning meme-related usernames).
- Joke Profile Creation: A profile creation process with ridiculous fields to match the comedic tone of the app, e.g. emotional age, spirit vegetable. 
- Personality Analysis: An AI tool analyzes user personality based on absurd questions and generates a nonsensical compatibility score.
- Fake Matchmaking: Swipeable, AI-generated profiles of glitchy people. Every swipe ends in an error message (e.g. user matched with NULL).
- Chaotic Pop-Ups: Pop-up alerts with ridiculous messages (e.g. soulmate buffering). One click pixelation and removal of a profile.
- Unmatch Roulette: Ability to trigger a button to randomly unmatch the user with an amusing, strange reason from "the spirit vegetable council."
- Disaster Chatbot: AI-powered chatbot dispenses horrible dating advice and bizarre messages.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, almost sickly Yellow (#D2B48C) evoking feelings of something old or decayed.
- Background color: Very light desaturated yellow (#F5F5DC). It retains the Yellow hue to ensure visual unity with the primary color, but is very desaturated and bright for use as a background.
- Accent color: A slightly desaturated Green (#90EE90); different in both brightness and saturation from the primary, providing a jolt of visual discordance, like something rotten.
- Body: 'Literata', a serif that conveys an out-of-date feel suitable for absurdism; Headers: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif), provides a cold, distant contrast to 'Literata.'
- Icons: Utilize a mix of broken, distorted, and nonsensical icons to represent the chaotic nature of the app. For instance, use pixelated hearts, glitched profile images, and error symbols.
- Incorporate asymmetrical and off-grid layouts to create a sense of unease and unpredictability. Misaligned elements, overlapping content, and unconventional spacing.
- Animations: Apply glitch effects, sudden jarring transitions, and unexpected movements to enhance the comedic absurdity.
