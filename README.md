## Project Description

**Love404** is a satirical dating app that embraces the chaos and absurdity of modern romance. Built with a dark sense of humor, it uses AI-powered interactions to deliver witty rejections, absurd bios, and cynical ‚Äúromantic‚Äù experiences. This is not your regular dating app ‚Äî it‚Äôs an anti-love simulator where the only thing you‚Äôre guaranteed is a good laugh and a healthy dose of disappointment.

## The Problem (that we all secretly enjoy)

Tired of dating apps promising you a soulmate, only to deliver awkward conversations, ghosting, and heartbreak? The real problem isn‚Äôt finding love ‚Äî it‚Äôs surviving the crushing disappointment when you don‚Äôt. So instead of fighting it, we decided to celebrate it.

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

Introducing **Love404** ‚Äî the dating app that doesn‚Äôt even try to help you find love. Instead of matches, you get witty AI-generated rejections. Instead of personality tests, you get a nonsense quiz that builds a ridiculous bio you‚Äôd never write yourself. It‚Äôs the full dating app experience‚Ä¶ minus the romance.
